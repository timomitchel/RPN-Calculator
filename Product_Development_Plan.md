## QA from Zack:

Can I assume a Rails app? 
Yes 
 
How many developers are dedicated to this project?
Just one on this feature, and you can assume that other developers are working on separate enough features that merge conflicts shouldn't add extra time.  

Are we bootstrapping the frontend or using a similar framework to reduce FE work and keep styling consistent?
Yes, assume the frontend will be built using an existing component library that includes fonts, styling, and basic components like buttons and dropdowns. 

How much time will we have for manual user testing of the product before we are dependent on the product for business need? 
Up to you. How much will we need? 

How many employees/admins will be using this product?
Assume we have an existing base of admins on the order of 10 - 100 and that an average job would receive approximately 100 applications. 

Do we need to set up an SMTP server for emailing or are we using ActionMailer?
We can assume that an existing email integration has been built using a third party like SendGrid or Mailchimp. 

Where and how is this app currently deployed? Heroku, AWS? 
Yes, deployed using Heroku, hosted on AWS. 

How many applicants do we expect for each job?
Approximately 0 - 100, maybe more in edge cases 

I'm assuming we have an applicant model and table in the DB already with the fields we need to sort by. Is this correct?
Assume that the model exists for jobs and admins, but that candidates/applicants are a new concept for this scope. 

Do we have automation tests for any parts of the app yet? This is necessary to cut down risk of bugs in its current form impeding more feature stories.
Yes, assume that the existing app has solid test coverage. Tests related to new features will need to be newly written as needed. 

## QA Zack Part 2:
Would we want to implement this story with one deploy or could we deploy each step of the acceptance criteria as we had it?
I'd like to hear your thoughts. If there is a smaller component of the story that you think would provide meaningful user value, feel free to plan to release in stages.

How long do deployments generally take?
About an hour

Do we have a CI/CD cycle set up? 
Yes

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Assume that the basic infrastructure of the application already exists including a
public-facing site that enables job seekers to submit applications.

2. When an admin user logs into HobNobJobs and navigates to My Jobs, show a list of job
openings assigned to the admin.

  * Stretch estimate: 30 minutes
* Test all of these
  * Conservative estimate: 1 hour
  * Stretch estimate: 30 minutes

particular job.
* Create Applicant Model and Table
  * Conservative estimate: 15 minutes
